## Requirements

* Command-T requires a Vim compiled with Ruby support.
* Tagbar uses exuberant-ctags. The installer will install it for Homebrew on OS
  X and on Debian-like systems (potentially including Fink).
* Tagbar is also configured to use lushtags for Haskell code. If the Haskell
  Platform and cabal are installed, the installer script will install it.

## Setup

`./install.sh`
